# Week Number

This code uses the `time` package to get the current time and then retrieves the corresponding week number using the `Week() method. It prints the week number using `fmt.Printf.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	currentTime := time.Now()
	weekNumber := currentTime.Week()
	fmt.Printf("Current Week Number: %d\n", weekNumber)
}

```

The Go `time.Time` type doesn't have a direct method for returning the ISO week number. However, you can use a helper function to calculate the week number. Here's an updated code snippet that implements this approach:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func GetISOWeekNumber(t time.Time) int {
	_, week := t.ISOWeek()
	return week
}

func main() {
	currentTime := time.Now()
	weekNumber := GetISOWeekNumber(currentTime)
	fmt.Printf("Current Week Number: %d\n", weekNumber)
}
```

In this code, we define a `GetISOWeekNumber` function that takes a ﻿time.Time value and returns the ISO week number. It uses the ﻿ISOWeek method to retrieve the year and week number, and then returns only the week number. The code `time.Now()` fetches the current time, and `GetISOWeekNumber` is called with this value to get the week number. Finally, the week number is printed using `fmt.Printf`.

The expression `_, week := t.ISOWeek()` extracts the week number from the ISO week-based date representation of a `time.Time` value `t`.
The `ISOWeek` method of the `time.Time` type returns two values: the year and the ISO week number. In Go, if you're not interested in a particular value, you can use the underscore `_` to discard it. In this case, we are only interested in the week number, so we assign it to the variable ﻿week while ignoring the year value.
Essentially, `t.ISOWeek()` returns the ISO year and week number of the provided `time.Time` value, and the expression `_, week := t.ISOWeek()` captures and assigns the week number to the variable `week,` discarding the year value.
